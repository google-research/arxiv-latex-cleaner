# `arxiv_latex_cleaner`

This tool allows you to easily clean the LaTeX code of your paper to submit to
arXiv. From a folder containing all your code, e.g. `/path/to/latex/`, it
creates a new folder `/path/to/latex_arXiv/`, that is ready to ZIP and upload to
arXiv.

## Example call:

```console
arxiv_latex_cleaner /path/to/latex --im_size 500 --images_whitelist='{"images/im.png":2000}'
```

Or simply from a config file

```console
arxiv_latex_cleaner /path/to/latex --config cleaner_config.yaml
```

## Installation:

```console
pip install arxiv-latex-cleaner
```

| :exclamation:  arxiv_latex_cleaner is only compatible with Python >=3  :exclamation: |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Alternatively, you can download the source code:

```console
git clone https://github.com/google-research/arxiv-latex-cleaner
cd arxiv-latex-cleaner/
python -m arxiv_latex_cleaner --help
```

And install as a command-line program directly from the source code:

```console
python setup.py install
```

## Main features:

#### Privacy-oriented

*   Removes all auxiliary files (`.aux`, `.log`, `.out`, etc.).
*   Removes all comments from your code (yes, those are visible on arXiv and you
    do not want them to be). These also include `\begin{comment}\end{comment}`
    and `\iffalse\fi` environments.
*   Optionally removes user-defined commands entered with `commands_to_delete`
    (such as `\todo{}` that you redefine as the empty string at the end).
*   Optionally allows you to define custom regex replacement rules through a
    `cleaner_config.yaml` file.

#### Size-oriented

There is a 50MB limit on arXiv submissions, so to make it fit:

*   Removes all unused `.tex` files (those that are not in the root and not
    included in any other `.tex` file).
*   Removes all unused images that take up space (those that are not actually
    included in any used `.tex` file).
*   Optionally resizes all images to `im_size` pixels, to reduce the size of the
    submission. You can whitelist some images to skip the global size using
    `images_whitelist`.
*   Optionally compresses `.pdf` files using ghostscript (Linux and Mac only).
    You can whitelist some PDFs to skip the global size using
    `images_whitelist`.

#### TikZ picture source code concealment

To prevent the upload of tikzpicture source code or raw simulation data, this
feature:

*   Replaces the tikzpicture environment `\begin{tikzpicture} ...
    \end{tikzpicture}` with the respective
    `\includegraphics{EXTERNAL_TIKZ_FOLDER/picture_name.pdf}`.
*   Requires externally compiled TikZ pictures as `.pdf` files in folder
    `EXTERNAL_TIKZ_FOLDER`. See section 53 in the
    [PGF/TikZ manual](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf?lang=en) on TikZ picture
    externalization.
*   Only replaces environments with preceding
    `\tikzsetnextfilename{picture_name}` command (as in
    `\tikzsetnextfilename{picture_name}\begin{tikzpicture} ...
    \end{tikzpicture}`) where the externalized `picture_name.pdf` filename
    matches `picture_name`.

#### More sophisticated pattern replacement based on regex group captures

Sometimes it is useful to work with a set of custom LaTeX commands when writing
a paper. To get rid of them upon arXiv submission, one can simply revert them to
plain LaTeX with a regular expression insertion.

```yaml
{
    "pattern" : '(?:\\figcomp{\s*)(?P<first>.*?)\s*}\s*{\s*(?P<second>.*?)\s*}\s*{\s*(?P<third>.*?)\s*}',
    "insertion" : '\parbox[c]{{ {second} \linewidth}} {{ \includegraphics[width= {third} \linewidth]{{figures/{first} }} }}',
    "description" : "Replace figcomp"
}
```

The pattern above will find all `\figcomp{path}{w1}{w2}` commands and replace
them with
`\parbox[c]{w1\linewidth}{\includegraphics[width=w2\linewidth]{figures/path}}`.
Note that the insertion template is filled with the
[named groups captures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-examples)
from the pattern. Note that the replacement is processed **before** all
`\includegraphics` commands are processed and corresponding file paths are
copied, making sure all figure files are copied to the cleaned version. See also
[cleaner_config.yaml](cleaner_config.yaml) for details on how to specify the
patterns.

                                   input_folder

Clean the LaTeX code of your paper to submit to arXiv. Check the README for
more information on the use.

positional arguments:
  input_folder          Input folder containing the LaTeX code.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --resize_images       Resize images.
  --im_size IM_SIZE     Size of the output images (in pixels, longest side).
                        Fine tune this to get as close to 10MB as possible.
  --compress_pdf        Compress PDF images using ghostscript (Linux and Mac
                        only).
  --pdf_im_resolution PDF_IM_RESOLUTION
                        Resolution (in dpi) to which the tool resamples the
                        PDF images.
  --images_whitelist IMAGES_WHITELIST
                        Images (and PDFs) that won't be resized to the default
                        resolution,but the one provided here. Value is pixel
                        for images, and dpi forPDFs, as in --im_size and
                        --pdf_im_resolution, respectively. Format is a
                        dictionary as: '{"path/to/im.jpg": 1000}'
  --keep_bib            Avoid deleting the *.bib files.
  --commands_to_delete COMMANDS_TO_DELETE [COMMANDS_TO_DELETE ...]
                        LaTeX commands that will be deleted. Useful for e.g.
                        user-defined \todo commands. For example, to delete
                        all occurrences of \todo1{} and \todo2{}, run the tool
                        with `--commands_to_delete todo1 todo2`.Please note
                        that the positional argument `input_folder` cannot
                        come immediately after `commands_to_delete`, as the
                        parser does not have any way to know if it's another
                        command to delete.
  --use_external_tikz USE_EXTERNAL_TIKZ
                        Folder (relative to input folder) containing
                        externalized tikz figures in PDF format.
  --config CONFIG       Read settings from `.yaml` config file. If command
                        line arguments are provided additionally, the config
                        file parameters are updated with the command line
                        parameters.
  --verbose             Enable detailed output.
